First, pour oil on to your frying pan and then wait for a few seconds.
Spread the dosa batter evenly on a frying pan with the bottom of a ladle.
Wait for a few seconds until the side facing the frying pan becomes crispy and brown.
Flip the dosa, and wait until the side facing down right now is cripsy and brown.
Take the dosa out carefully, and then put it on a plate.
Add some sambar/chutney or anything you want to have with it, and you can eat now!
